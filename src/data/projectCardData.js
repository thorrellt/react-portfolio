This application was built to help increase the speed and efficiency that the representatives from MC311 can access information and handle calls. This is primarily done by generating fleshed out notes based on minimal user inputs, and aggregating commonly accessed data. The idea is that reducing the redundancies associated with this job would help representatives assist more residents.",
